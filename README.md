# Big-Data-Analytics
This project designs and implements an end-to-end Big Data Analytics Pipeline using a distributed data processing framework, such as Apache Spark, deployed on a compute cluster. The project adheres to Big Data analytics principles by working on "The Horse Racing Results – UK & Ireland (2015–2025)" dataset, which holds 1670880 rows and 37 columns. This project aims answer three main questions: 
1. Predict finishing times from race and horse features
2. Estimate the margin of victory using race conditions
3. Predict finishing position from pre-race data.

The proposed approach involves cleaning and preparing the horse racing dataset, selecting relevant race and horse features, defining continuous outcome variables, and applying Linear Regression as a baseline model alongside a Decision Tree Regressor to capture non-linear patterns. Models will be evaluated using time-based validation and standard regression metrics to generate predictive and interpretable insights.
